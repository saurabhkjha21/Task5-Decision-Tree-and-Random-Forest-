#  Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees & Random Forests

This project uses machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical attributes. The models implemented are **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers using the `heart.csv` dataset.

---

##  Objective

- Train a **Decision Tree Classifier** and visualize it.
- Analyze **overfitting** by controlling tree depth.
- Train a **Random Forest Classifier** and compare performance.
- Interpret **feature importances**.
- Evaluate both models using **cross-validation**.

---

##  Dataset

The dataset `heart.csv` includes several medical attributes such as:

- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type (4 values)
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate
- `exang`: Exercise induced angina
- `oldpeak`: ST depression
- `target`: 1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- graphviz (optional for advanced tree visualization)
